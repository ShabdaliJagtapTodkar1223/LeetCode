Question :-

619. Biggest Single Number

Table: MyNumbers
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 
A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.

Example 2:
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.


Answer :-

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM MyNumbers
WHERE (num) IN (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)



Explanation :- Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs compare COUNT() vs MAX() on empty sets, since they behave differently in SQL.

Example with your table:
MyNumbers
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |


1. Your query with MAX(num)
SELECT MAX(num) AS result
FROM MyNumbers
WHERE num IN (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);

Subquery (HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) returns empty set.
So the outer query has no rows.
MAX() on no rows ‚Üí returns NULL.

üëâ Result:
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| NULL   |
+--------+


2. If we try with COUNT(num)
SELECT COUNT(num) AS result
FROM MyNumbers
WHERE num IN (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);

Again, subquery returns empty set.
So the outer query has no rows.
COUNT() is special ‚Üí it always returns 0 if there are no rows.

üëâ Result:
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 0      |
+--------+

‚úÖ Key Difference:
MAX() (or MIN(), AVG(), SUM()) ‚Üí returns NULL when no rows.
COUNT() ‚Üí returns 0 when no rows.
